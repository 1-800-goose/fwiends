# Creative Project 2 Project Specification
## Overview
For your second Creative Project, you will get a bit of practice with what we're learning about JavaScript (JS) to add interactivity a web page using the DOM and event handlers. As a creative project, you have freedom to have more ownership in your work, as long as you meet the requirements listed below.

We encourage you to explore the new material covered in class, as well as related (but optional) content we may link to along the way, as long as you follow the CSE 154 code quality guidelines. This is your chance to:

1. Continue to build websites that you can link to on your resume or code portfolio (CPs can be public, most HWs cannot be).
2. Ask instructors and/or TAs about features you want to learn how to implement (we can provide more support for CPs than HWs) and ask for feedback/ideas on Ed.
3. Apply what you're learning in CSE 154 to projects you are personally interested in and may use outside of just a CSE 154 assignment.
4. Get feedback on code quality when learning new technologies in CSE 154 to implement for the corresponding HW, which will be worth more points.

In past quarters, some students have built upon their Creative Project each week. You may choose to do a new website for each CP, or build on a single project, as long as you meet each CP's requirements.

## Ideas for CP2
As long as you meet the requirements outlined below, you have freedom in what kind of
website you create. Here are some ideas:
* Continue to extend your portfolio page to add interactivity in some way.
* Write a website to implement drag/drop features.
* Write a to-do list or an option list where you can add or remove items.
* Write something where you add or remove paragraphs or images to/from your page.
* Build a form that adds new features/options based on user input.
* Build a "create your own adventure" game that responds to the users choices.
* Implement a timeout/interval feature, etc.
* Write a website to visualize data structures like arrays, lists, or maps.
* Write a website to solve math/science/etc. formulae.
* You might find Section examples helpful for some inspiration! But your work must be your own - credit will not be given to submissions that reuse solutions from class (including Section/Lecture).

## Getting Started
This Creative Project pieces together the languages you've learned in Module 1 as well as the basics of JavaScript you're learning about in Module 2 (responding to events, DOM manipulation, etc.). Knowing where to start with JS for the first time can be difficult (but exciting!) so this is how we suggest breaking down this assignment:
1. **Start with the HTML/CSS**: Write the HTML/CSS for your page first. This gives you a front end to work with and reference before implementing any JavaScript code. Keep the DOM tree in mind as you are structuring your HTML. This will be useful as you move into JS implementation. You should aim to invest about 25-30% of the time you dedicate to CP2 on this part.
    * Tip: When support user interactivity to a webpage, you may find it useful to think about different UI elements (like buttons or input boxes) and can find a good list of common ones [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets) for some inspiration.
2. **Break Down the UI**: This requires no coding! Remember, JavaScript is _event driven_ meaning that everything occurs in response to an event such as a "click" of a button, a "change" of a radio button, a "keypress", or a window "load." Spend the time thinking about what you want to implement and how you will do that. Something that you may find helpful is filling out a table like this. An example for a hypothetical page has been filled out for you:

  | event | element listening to event | response/elements changed |
|-------|---------|---------|
| click  | img with id `#kitty`  | img changes from cat image to dog image  |
| ...  | ... | ...  |

  The event in this case is a "click" event that takes place on an image with id `#kitty`. The response functionality to the event is a change in the image from a cat to a dog.

  Invest about 40% of the total time you expect to spend on this assignment on this part.

3. **Write the JavaScript**: Finally you are ready to write the JavaScript. Take it piece by piece and refer back to the brainstorming you did. If you need to reference proper syntax or forgot how to do something shown in lecture refer back to the slides/examples. Also, as you are coding, remember to use the console as demonstrated in lecture. It is a great way for you to experiment with JavaScript and get instant feedback. Aim to invest about 30-35% of the total time you expect to spend on the assignment on this part.
    - _note_: we have just brushed the surface with JavaScript and we will be diving deep into the many useful features of the language over the next few weeks. To start, focus on perfecting steps 1 and 2 and use what you learned so far to get more experience turning your brainstorming into an implementation. This will make part 3 much more approachable as you become more familiar with JavaScript, and take advantage of OH/WPL/Ed if you'd like to talk through some JS implementation strategies!

## External Requirements
* Your project must include the following three files at a minimum:
  * `index.html` - main page of your website
  * `styles.css` - file to style your `.html` file
  * `index.js` - containing your JavaScript code
* Your website must contain at least one HTML page linked to `index.js` to respond to page events as we've discussed in class. It must respond to a page UI event (e.g. changes to a dropdown option or a button click, etc.) or a
     mouse or keyboard event (refer to **Keyboard Events** and **Mouse Events** from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)). If you would like to explore an event we don't cover in CSE154 on your project but don't know where to get started, feel free to ask.
* At least one of your event handler functions should change the document (DOM) in some way using `element.appendChild()`, `element.removeChild()`, or `element.replaceChild()`
* Event handler functions should be non-trivial, meaning it must be possible they change the page or program "state" in response to the event (i.e. a `console.log`, `alert` statement or unused variable assignment is trivial)
    * There are many different ways JS can be used to respond work with the page. If you are unsure about this requirement for your Creative Project, ask!
* Modify a `classList` of an element (using one of `add`/`remove`/`toggle`) using class that is defined in a linked CSS file.
* You should implement _at minimum_ one non-trivial, named function in your `.js` code. All code in `index.js` must be your own work (you may use the `id`, `qs`, and `qsa` functions shown in lecture. These helper functions do not count as the one named function).
* Make sure to test your webpage UI so that it works properly when a user interacts with page elements - you aren't expected to handle _all_ possible error cases, but part of your grade will come from being able to respond to an user event without an error.
* Tip: You can find a list of some different event types your page can listen for [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) (not comprehensive) and post on Ed or go to Office Hours if you want to explore those not covered in class!

## Internal Requirements
* Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should demonstrate good code quality as demonstrated in class and
  detailed in the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/). Part of your grade will come from using consistent indentation, proper naming conventions, curly brace locations, etc. Lecture/section examples
demonstrate JS naming/whitespace conventions in this course, but there are more examples [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/javascript/#whitespace-before-blocks).
* When adding interactivity to your website, you should handle any events (like a mouse event, keyboard event, timer, etc.)
  by responding them using a JavaScript function(s) in your `.js` file. You should not have any JavaScript code in your HTML and you should not have any HTML tags as strings in your JavaScript code (e.g. `el.innerHTML = "<p>Foo</p>";`).
* Your `index.js` file should be linked to your `index.html` or other `.html` files using
   `<script src="...">` in the HTML `<head>`.
* Links to your `.html`,  `.css` and `.js` files should be **relative links**, not absolute.
* Minimize styling in JS (e.g. changing the `.style` property of elements) - prefer adding/removing classes to DOM elements instead, and
  style the classes in your CSS. Remember that there is an exception when dynamically generating values for styles or positions that are not reasonably factored out in CSS.
* Any `.js` code you use must use the module-global pattern (recall the module-global template) and `"use strict";`.
* Your page should have a `window.addEventListener("load", functionName)` as shown in lecture/section/lab (use an appropriate `functionName`).
* Decompose your JS by writing smaller, more generic functions that complete one task rather than a few larger "do-everything" functions.
* Localize your variables as much as possible. You should not use any global variables (outside the module pattern) - see [Code Quality Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/javascript/#module-pattern) for reference.
* Only use module-global variables whenever absolutely necessary.
* Use `const` with `UPPER_CASED` naming conventions (instead of `let`) for program constants (e.g. a file path to your images if you are working with many images in your JS).
* For full credit, all HTML, CSS and JS files must be well-formed and pass validation. The HTML, CSS and JS validator/linters will run automatically each time you commit and push your work. In order to be eligible for full points on this CP, your code must pass all validation/linting (indicated by no errors and a green checkmark). See the resources page for a detailed guide explaining how to view your feedback. Note that these validators/linters may take some time to run so make sure you leave enough time to make any necessary changes before the deadline. A slow linter is not a valid reason for why an assignment was turned in late.
* If you want to explore other JS features beyond what we've taught in class, you must cite what resources you used to learn them in order to be eligible for credit. We strongly encourage students to ask the staff for resources instead of finding online tutorials on their own (some are better than others).
* **All file names, links and extensions in your project must be lowercased without spaces** (e.g. `img/puppy.jpg` but not `img/puppy.JPG` or `img/Puppy.jpg`). This is enforced to avoid broken links commonly occurring in CP/HW submissions due to case-insensitivity of file names on Windows machines. In general, it is also just good practice for file/directory naming.

## Documentation
* Place a comment header in each file with your name, section, and a brief description of the file's purpose in your website. An example `.js` file comment is given below:

    ```
    /*
     * Name: Mowgli Hovik
     * Date: April 1, 2020
     * Section: CSE 154 AL
     *
     * This is the JS to implement the UI for my cryptogram generator and generates
     * different types of ciphers from user input.
     */
    ```
* Use [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) to document _all_ of your JS functions with `@param`, `@returns` as discussed in the [Code Quality Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/javascript/#comments-function-header).

## Grading
Grading for Creative Projects is lighter with the chance to explore and learn without the overhead of having to match strict external requirements. Our goal is to give you feedback, particularly on the internal requirements and documentation, so you can incorporate this feedback in your homework assignments which will be worth more towards your final grade.

This CP will be out of 10 points and will likely (subject to adjustments) be distributed as:

- External Correctness (~50%)
- Internal Correctness (~40%)
- Documentation (~10%)

### Academic Integrity
Creative Projects are unique in that students may look for outside resources for inspiration or assistance in accomplishing their goals. On occasion students may wish to use portions of sample code that has been obtained on our course website or others. In order to avoid academic misconduct for a Creative Project in CSE 154 you must include school appropriate content and follow the Academic Integrity/Collaboration Policies outlined in more detail on the syllabus. If we find inappropriate content or plagiarism in CPs **you will be ineligible for any points on the CP**. Ask the instructor if you're unsure if your work is cited appropriately. Any external sources like images should be cited where used in the source code or (ideally) visible in a page footer. Refer to this [copyright example](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/21au/resources/assets/code-examples/copyright-examples/copyrightexample2.html) page for how to cite images from different sources.
